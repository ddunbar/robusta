=====================================
 Robusta -- A Taste Testing Web App.
=====================================

Robusta is a web app for running (double blind) taste tests.

It was originally designed for running coffee taste testings, but in theory can
be used for testing just about anything.

Concepts
========

Robust is designed around the concept of a "Tasting" run. A tasting consists of:

 * Information on the event (name, etc.).

 * Information on the test matrix:

   * Test products or steps, and approximate number of permutations (for
     labelling purposes).

   * Rating metrics.
